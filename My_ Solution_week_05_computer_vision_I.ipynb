Consequently, neural networks do not really gain much from multiple Linear layers that one Linear layer couldn't have done, and also generally have trouble capturing higher-order polynomial dependencies in data.\n",

        "However, there is a solution to this problem! A so-called activation function is commonly added after every Linear layer (and typically also after convolutions, which we will get to later), and its purpose is to introduce some form of non-linear transformation between our affine transformations. The combination `Affine + Affine` can be expressed as a single Affine, so it can encode the information of only one Affine Transformation. The combination `Affine + Non-linear function + Affine` cannot be expressed as a single Affine anymore. In this case, having two separate Affine Transformations is suddenly useful, and the issues capturing non-linear and particularly higher-order polynomial dependencies are lessened.\n",

As a potential downside, the activations saturate for large absolute values (see plot). If our weights are large enough, this can create problems: Suddenly, all our activations look similar, even for very different inputs. This is typically very undesirable, and can cause models to stop learning.\n",
        "- ReLU has no continuous non-linearity, only a single point (zero) at which the function is not continuous. It is somewhat weaker in capturing non-linear dependencies as a result. However, it has really friendly and smooth gradients, which makes training with ReLU very stable and reliable. If your model ever doesn't learn, it's probably not ReLU's fault.\n",
        "- Swish is a modern activation function that was found by systematically testing random combinations or chains of functions and observing how they performed as activation functions. It looks very similar to ReLU and approaches ReLU for large absolute values, but has a smooth non-linearity around 0 instead of a kink. Generally, it has the same advantages as ReLU, and is said to have the same downsides except less pronounced. There are many other brands of \"ReLU but slightly different\" out there. If you're ever looking to squeeze out the final few drops of performance from your model, it can be worth checking them out.\n",

Secondly, most have a region where they function best. Take for example, the sigmoid, which neatly differentiates inputs near zero, but provides almost the same output for inputs that are very large or small. Typically this region is also near zero."

        "In a modern neural network, convolutional layers are ubiquitous. The computer will, over the course of the training, adapt the contents of the convolution kernels in order to best represent and categorize the images it sees. Features in early convolutional layers correspond to the actual content of the image and make intuitive sense to a human observer - to classify cars, you can expect to be needing a couple of differently angled straight lines, some smooth curves, and circles for the wheels, for example. The features in later layers are less (or not at all) interpretable to human eyes. At that point, the image that the computer has, typically consists of activation maps of activation maps of activation maps of ... well, you get the gist.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is still possible to visualize what these represent, and some of the features are surprisingly human-interpretable (such as an entire car wheel, or the texture of a brick wall), while others look like LSD-induced hallucinations.

        "Convolution operations are defined by their number of in-going and out-going signal channels. At the beginning of a neural network, the in-going channel number is typically 3 (for RGB images) or 1 (for grayscale images). The out-going channel number can be freely chosen. Convolution operations can have any kernel size, but typically its height and width are chosen as odd numbers. This is done because the convolution kernel is applied to the area around the anchor pixel in our original image - a kernel with odd dimensions can be centered exactly on this anchor, while one with even dimensions can not. The latter case causes interesting systematic errors, which are fun to look at, but have a tendency to ruin the performance of the neural network."

        "**Pooling operations** - Conceptually, a pooling operation is quite simple. We compute a new image from a pooling operation by starting at a pixel, and applying the pooling operator to the pixel and its surroundings. The result is the value of the a new pixel. This process is repeated for every pixel in the image and you get a new image. Typically, the pooling operator either performs the max() or the mean() operation on the area it is applied to. These specific pooling ops are name MaxPool and AvgPool, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Very often, something called a 'stride' is applied during the pooling operation. 'A stride of *s*' means that in order to get a new image, we do not iterate over every pixel and perform pooling on its respective surrounding, but that we instead skip *s* rows and columns on each step. Typically, stride and pooling operator shapes are chosen to be the same, so that no pixel is ignored during the calculations, and so that no pixel contributes to the new image more than once. Consequently, the new image after a pooling operation will be downscaled by a factor *s*. Since, in a sense, the new image still contains *all, or most of the relevant* information from the original image, strided pooling is often used for exactly this downscaling effect. This reduces the amount of computation needed for later steps, and helps extracting the most relevant information from an image.\n",
        "\n",
        "If you try to imagine applying a 2x2 pooling operator to, say, a 5x5 image, do you notice a problem? No matter how you define the 2x2 surrounding of your current pixel, some pixels you need to calculate the result of the pooling operator will not exist - they would be outside the bounds of our image! This is a very common occurence, and pooling operations perform something called *padding*. Padding extends the image by the necessary pixels, just for the calculations of pixels that actually exist. Typically, the image is extended using pixels which exclusively have the values zero, although other paddings exist. Convolution operations sometimes do the same thing, for the same reason."
